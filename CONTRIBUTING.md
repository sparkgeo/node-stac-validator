# How to contribute

Thanks for reading this. We love having external collaborators on our OpenSource projects.

## Testing

If submitting a PR, please ensure the code has appropriate tests.

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
