This folder contains standards as well as samples collected from the Radiant Earth stac specification found at [https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/).

At this time, the js mirror the json files provisionned, but they may change in the future in order to afford this validator increased modularity and reusability across versions of STAC.
